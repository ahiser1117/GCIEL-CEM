An educational playground to explore electromagnetic fields

The goal of this project is to provide students with a fun and engaging environment that allows them to build intuition around electromagnetic fields, how they are produced and change. Eventually when the student is presented with the mathematical formulas describing this behavior they are better prepared to visualize how these formulas look and perform.
